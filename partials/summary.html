	<p>Hello World!</p>

	<p>My name is Panagiotis Pantouveris and I am an ambitious software developer. I finished my studies in Computer Science at the University of Piraeus in June 2015. While still being a student I participated in the Erasmus internship program which gave me a chance to put in practice my theoretical knowledge while getting an experience working abroad. In addition I worked at Velti gaining even more experience on the field. Since I graduated from college I was recruited in the Greek army, fulfilling my militay obligations. At this period however I didn't get rusty. I was part of the Reserch and Information Technology Unit working in the Centre of Information Technology Support of the Hellenic Army (KEPYES).</p>

	<p>I have a passion for coding and learning new technologies. I believe I am hard working, self motivated and dedicated to my own continual self development. Through my carrer so far I gained a good background knowledge in various technologies, more specifically I worked with Java, for web applications working with JSF and the Android environment, all the basic web technologies (HTML, CSS, Javascript, jQuery) and experimented with AngularJS.</p>
	
	<p>Currently I am about to finish my military obligations (October 2016) and searching for the right carrer move for me. I believe that the combination of my so far experience and personality makes me a great candidate for the technologies mentioned above but I'm also up to a new challenge! I am eager to learn and be part of a team where I can be helpful and productive and of course learn and develop my skills.</p>
